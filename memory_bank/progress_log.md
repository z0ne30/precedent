# Progress Log

*   **[Timestamp]** - Initialized memory bank system by creating `execution_plan.md`, `progress_log.md`, and `decision_log.md`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Analyzed Project:** Reviewed `package.json` and project structure. Identified `pnpm` as the current package manager, conflicting with the requirement to use `yarn`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step A.1 (Switch Package Manager to Yarn):** Removed `pnpm-lock.yaml`, `node_modules`, removed `packageManager` field from `package.json`, and successfully ran `yarn install`. Lockfile `yarn.lock` created. Noted peer dependency warnings for `focus-trap-react` and `next`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step A.2 (Install Prisma CLI):** Successfully added `prisma` (v6.5.0) as a dev dependency using `yarn add -D prisma`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step A.3 (Initialize Prisma):** Successfully ran `yarn prisma init --datasource-provider postgresql`. Created `prisma/schema.prisma` and added `DATABASE_URL` placeholder to `.env`. Verified `.env` is already in `.gitignore`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step A.4 (Configure Database Connection):** Updated `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` with the non-pooling connection string found in the existing `POSTGRES_URL_NONPOOLING` variable.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step A.5 (Define Schema Model):** Added a basic `User` model (id, email, name) to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step B.6 & B.7 (Run Initial Migration & Generate Prisma Client):** Successfully ran `yarn prisma migrate dev --name init`. Migration `20250403160816_init` created and applied. Prisma Client (v6.5.0) generated automatically.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step C.8 (Create Prisma Client Singleton):** Created `lib/prisma.ts` with the recommended singleton pattern for Prisma Client instantiation in Next.js.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step C.9 (Create Test API Route):** Created `app/api/test-db/route.ts` with a GET handler to fetch users using the Prisma Client singleton.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Step C.10 (Test API Route):** Successfully tested the `/api/test-db` endpoint using `curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db`. Received `{"users":[]}` response, confirming database connection and Prisma setup.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Prisma Integration:** All steps in `memory_bank/execution_plan.md` are complete.
*   **[Timestamp]** - **Completed Landing Page / Contact Form Implementation:**
    *   Added `ContactSubmission` model to `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   Attempted migration with non-pooling URL (failed P1001).
    *   Switched `DATABASE_URL` in `.env` to use direct connection string (`POSTGRES_URL`).
    *   Successfully ran `yarn prisma migrate dev --name add_contact_submission`. Migration `20250403162453_add_contact_submission` created and applied.
    *   Created contact form API route handler at `app/api/contact/route.ts`.
    *   Ran `yarn prisma generate` explicitly to resolve TS error and update Prisma Client types.
    *   Updated `app/page.tsx` to be a client component with state management and form submission logic targeting `/api/contact`.
    *   Tested contact form submission using `curl` POST request to `/api/contact`; received success message.
    *   Verified database entry by temporarily modifying `/api/test-db` to fetch submissions and confirming via `curl`; reverted `/api/test-db` afterwards.
